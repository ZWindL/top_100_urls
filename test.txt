Dictionaries
might
be
a
bit
confusing
to
a
new
programmer
Try
to
think
of
it
like
a
language
dictionary
If
you
don’t
know
or
remember
exactly
how
bijection
differs
from
surjection
you
can
look
the
two
terms
up
in
the
Oxford
English
Dictionary
The
same
principle
applies
when
you
print
hello
except
rather
than
print
a
literary
definition
it
prints
the
value
associated
with
the
keyword
‘hello’
as
defined
by
you
when
you
created
the
dictionary
named
d
In
this
case
that
value
is
“0”
Note
that
you
use
curly
braces
to
define
a
dictionary
but
square
brackets
to
access
things
within
it
The
keys
operation
returns
a
list
of
keys
that
are
defined
in
the
dictionary
